# Weight-Multiplicities

This is a group of programs in addendum to the article [*On Kostant's Weight $q$-Multiplicity Formula for $\mathfrak{sp}_6(\mathbb{C})$*]("Will have a link when we have a link") written by the authors of this repository. These programs perform various computations related to representations of the Lie algebra of type $C_3$ ($\mathfrak{sp}_6(\mathbb{C})$).

## Programs Pertaining Solely to the Article

### sigma calculations.nb

In the article we need to calculate $\sigma(\lambda + \rho) - \mu - \rho$ for every $\sigma$ in the Weyl group, $W$. To use this program, first run the first cell to send the definitions to the kernel. The parameter `Sigma` is a $\sigma \in W$ written with the $s_i$'s separated by commas (ie. $s_1s_2s_3$ becomes s1, s2, s3).

```Mathematica
Simplify[Composition[Simplify, Sigma][
   Distribute[(m + n + k + 3)*alpha1] + 
    Distribute[(m + 2 n + 2 k + 5)*alpha2] + 
    Distribute[(m/2 + n + (3/2)*k + 3)*alpha3]] + 
  Distribute[-(x + y + z + 3)*alpha1] + 
  Distribute[-(x + 2 y + 2 z + 5)*alpha2] + 
  Distribute[-(x/2 + y + (3/2)*z + 3)*alpha3]]
  ```

### remove-contradictions.py (I, II, and I and II)

In the article, we define 2 types of contradictions which arise forbidding certain subsets of the Weyl group from appearing as Weyl alternation sets. updated-alt-sets.py contains the lists returned by remove-contradictions-type-I.py (`currentAltSets1`), remove-contradictions-type-II.py when `currentAltSets1` is passed (`currentAltSets2`), and remove-contradictions-type-I-and-II.py when `currentAltSets2` is passed (`currentAltSets3`).

- remove-contradictions-type-I.py returns the subsets of the Weyl group which do not cause a contradiction of type I. 
- remove-contradictions-type-II.py, when given a list of subsets of the Weyl group, returns the subsets which do not cause a contradiction of type II. The parameter `sets` is a list of sets (the sets being subsets of the Weyl group). `currentAltSets1` is the list returned by remove-contradictions-type-I.py
  ```Python
  print(removeSubsets(sets))
  ```
- remove-contradictions-type-I-and-II.py, when given a list of subsets of the Weyl group, returns the subsets which do not cause a contradiction of type I or II or both together. The parameter `sets` is a list of sets (the sets being subsets of the Weyl group). `currentAltSets2` is the list returned by remove-contradictions-type-II.py
  ```Python
  print(removeSubsets(sets))
  ```

## Other Programs

### Evaluating the q-analog of Kostant's partition function.nb

Computes the $q$-analog of Kostant's partition function for a weight. Parameters ``m``, ``n``, and ``k`` are the triple representing a linear combination of the simple roots $m\alpha_1+n\alpha_2+k\alpha_3$. 

```Mathematica
P[m, n, k]
```

### q-mult-formula.py

Calculates and Kostant's Weight $q$-multiplicity formula in terms of the capital letters $A$ through $Q$ (defined in the article). To run, type python3 q-mult-formula.py, you will be prompted to enter lambda, then mu as triples of the form `(x,y,z)` representing linear combinations of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$.

### calculate-alt-sets.sage

- Compute Weyl alternation sets. Parameters ``lam`` and ``mu`` are triples representing linear combinations of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$. 
```Python
weyl_alternation_set(lam,mu=(0,0,0))
weyl_alternation_set_17(lam, mu=(0,0,0))
```

- Gives the Weyl alternation sets, together with a $\lambda$ and $\mu$ pair (printed as triples) which induce the alternation set, which appear for $\lambda$ with coefficients between 0 and `lamnum` and $\mu$ with coefficients between 0 and `munum`.
```Python
alt_sets_with_mus(lamnum,munum)
```

- Gives the Weyl alternation sets, together with a $\lambda$ and $\mu$ pair (printed as triples) which induce the alternation set, which appear for $\lambda$ with coefficients between 0 and `lamnum` and $\mu$ with coefficients between 0 and `munum` for $m+k+x+z$ divisible by 2 (when $\lambda$ equals the triple `(m,n,k)` and $\mu$ equals the triple `(x,y,z)`).
```Python
alt_sets_new_lattice(lamnum, munum)
```

### C3_weight_multiplicities.sage

- Compute Kostant's partition function and its $q$-analog for a weight. Parameter ``xi`` is a triple ``(m,n,k)`` representing a linear combination of the simple roots $m\alpha_1+n\alpha_2+k\alpha_3$. 
```Python
kostant_partition_function(xi, q_analog=True)
```
- Compute Kostant's weight multiplicity formula and its $q$-analog. Parameters ``lam`` and ``mu`` are triples representing linear combinations of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$.
```Python
kostant_weight_multiplicity(lam, mu=(0,0,0), q_analog=True)
```
 - Compute Weyl alternation sets. Parameters ``lam`` and ``mu`` are triples representing linear combinations of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$.
 ```Python
 weyl_alternation_set(lam,mu=(0,0,0))
 ```
 - Compute and display empty regions (weights lambda for which no Weyl group elements contribute to the weight multiplicity m(lambda, mu)). Parameter ``mu`` is a triple representing a linear combination of the fundamental weights $\omega_1,\omega_2,\omega_3$. Parameter ``dist`` specifies the maximum magnitude of the components of lambda the program should check and plot. Parameters ``color`` and ``size`` specify the color and size of the points in the plot
 ```Python
 plot_empty_region(mu, dist=15, color='red', size=25)
 ```
 - Plot Weyl alternation diagrams for a given weight mu and a list of Weyl group elements. If not restricted, plots weights lambda such that the alternation set for lambda, mu is contains ``sigmas``. If restricted, plots weights lambda such that the alternation set for lambda, mu is exactly ``sigmas``. 
 ```Python
 plot_alternation_diagram(sigmas, mu=(0,0,0), restricted=False, color='red', dist=20, size=15)
 ```

## Examples

First we compute the Weyl alternation set for $\lambda=2\omega_1+3\omega_2+4\omega_3$ and $\mu=0$. We then compute the weight $q$-multiplicity for $\lambda$ and $\mu$.
```Python
> load('C3_weight_multiplicities.sage')
> weyl_alternation_set(lam=(2,3,4), mu=(0,0,0))
{s1*s2*s1, s3*s1*s2, s1*s2, s2*s1, s3*s1, s1, s2*s3, s3*s2, s2, s3, 1}
> kostant_weight_multiplicity(lam=(2,3,4), mu=(0,0,0), q_analog=True)
q^35 + 2*q^34 + 5*q^33 + 8*q^32 + 14*q^31 + 19*q^30 + 28*q^29 + 34*q^28 + 45*q^27 + 50*q^26 + 61*q^25 + 63*q^24 + 72*q^23 + 69*q^22 + 74*q^21 + 64*q^20 + 64*q^19 + 48*q^18 + 44*q^17 + 27*q^16 + 22*q^15 + 10*q^14 + 7*q^13 + 2*q^12 + q^11
```

Here, we plot the restricted Weyl alternation diagram for {1, s1} and ``mu=0``:
```Python
> plot_alternation_diagram([e,s1], mu=(0,0,0), restricted=False, size=40)
Launched jmol viewer for Graphics3d Object
```
Output:
![alternation diagram](1s1.png?raw=true)
